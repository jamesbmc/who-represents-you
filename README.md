# Who Represents You?

This R application allows users to input an address. The program then compiles a report based on data from the [ProPublic API](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api) and the [Google Civic Information API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/) about the political representatives of the input address.

The Shiny application can be found [here](https://jamesbmc.shinyapps.io/who-represents-you/)
